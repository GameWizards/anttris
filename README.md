# anttris

## The Name
anttris is anti-tetris; you destroy things rather than build them! 

Check out [gamewizards.github.io](http://gamewizards.github.io)

## Obtaining Godot
You will need to obtain the [Godot game engine](http://www.godotengine.org/wp/download/) for your platform. Portable binaries [app bundle for OS X] are available for: 
* Mac OS X (32-bit only) 
* Microsoft Windows (32- and 64-bit binaries available) 
* GNU/Linux (32- and 64-bit available, plus 64-bit headless server).

These are portable, so they can be placed anywhere you want (`~/bin/` might be a good place.)  

Additionally, Godot's source code is available from their [Github repository](https://github.com/okamstudio/godot).

## Building and Running
1.  Clone this repository to your own filesystem. Via https at the command line: `git clone https://github.com/GameWizards/anttris.git`
2. Launch the appropriate Godot executable.
3. You will be greeted with Godot's project manager. Click "import" at the right, and navigate to the Anttris top level directory using the file browser that comes up.
4. Find `engine.cfg` and open it. Godot should open the project now. At this point, you can click the "play" button at the top of the screen to start up the game immediately. 
5. See Godot's [own documentation](https://github.com/okamstudio/godot/wiki) for more!

## Exporting a Standalone App
As Godot is still in beta, this is currently buggy, and we don't recommend trying it for now. For the adventurous, however, it does works best on Windows. OS X exports seem to never work on the computer they were exported on. [More at the wiki](https://github.com/okamstudio/godot/wiki/export).
